------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview

`BotHider` is a plugin for **Counter-Strike 2** that makes bots look like real human players.

- Removes the `BOT` tag from the scoreboard
- Each bot gets its own SteamID64, display name, ping, crosshair, scoreboard flair, and optional custom PNG avatar
- Adds a fake ping
- Applies a scoreboard flair medal

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Install

1. Download the latest `BotHider-windows.zip` or `BotHider-linux.zip` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/XBribo/CS2-Bot-Hider/releases/latest).
2. Extract the archive and copy the `/addons/` folder into your server's `/game/csgo/` directory.
3. Restart the server.

The packaged `addons/BotHider/config.json` selects the identity mode, automatic vote behavior, and fake-ping behavior. Use `"player"` to keep BotHider's synthetic-player presentation, or use `"bot"` to retain Valve's native bot flags. Set `"auto_vote_for_managed_bots": false` when using CS2 Vote Improver so Vote Improver is the only plugin that updates the native vote controller; the default is `true` for backward compatibility. Fake-ping values are constrained to the configured inclusive range. Missing settings use the packaged defaults.

## Console Commands

| Command | Description |
| --------- | ------------- |
| `bh_status` | Show every bot's details |
| `bh_setname <slot> <name>` | Change a bot's name |
| `bh_setsid <slot> <SteamID64>` | Change a bot's SteamID |
| `bh_setflair <slot> <item_def_index>` | Change a bot's scoreboard flair (`0` clears it) |
| `bh_setavatar <slot> <png_path/0>` | Apply a server-local PNG avatar, or use `0` to clear it (`@css/root` or server console/RCON) |
| `bh_identity_mode <player/bot>` | Change the managed-bot identity mode |
| `bh_namesource <0/1>` | **0** = use name from `botprofile.db` (default)<br>**1** = use name from `bot_info.json` (only affects new bots) |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Custom Bot Avatars

BotHider can apply a server-local PNG file as the avatar of a managed bot. The file must:

- Be a valid, non-empty PNG
- Be no larger than **16 KiB**
- Be readable by the game server

Use the engine player slot shown by `bh_status`. Quote paths that contain spaces:

```text
bh_setavatar 1 "E:/game/csgo/addons/avatars/player.png"
bh_setavatar 1 0
```

These commands can be executed from the server console/RCON or by a CounterStrikeSharp administrator with `@css/root`. `bh_status` reports avatar state as `avatar=<applied>/<bytes>`, for example `avatar=True/8011B`.

The avatar is associated with the bot's final SteamID64. BotHider automatically rebinds it when that bot's SteamID changes, clears the old override when the bot disconnects, and prevents a new bot in the same slot from inheriting it.

CS2 uses separate caches for some HUD surfaces. `ServerAvatarOverrides` updates the scoreboard avatar, but the compact score strip can retain its previous cached avatar and is not guaranteed to refresh immediately.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Custom Identities (bot_info.json)

You can create a file named `bot_info.json` inside `/game/csgo/addons/BotHider/` to define custom identities for your bots. Example:

```json
{
    "73936547": {
        "player_name": "s1mple",
        "crosshair_code": "CSGO-pE5f8-6RQvk-HLpdN-KW3J6-BQwLA",
        "scoreboard_flair": 6034
    },
    "153400465": {
        "player_name": "ZywOo",
        "crosshair_code": "CSGO-FqJYj-kLuW3-V2QZ3-xbkQK-PHPYE",
        "scoreboard_flair": 5226
    }
}
```

- **steamid**: The 32-bit account ID (will be converted to a full SteamID64 automatically).
- **crosshair_code**: The crosshair share code to apply to the bot (optional).
- **scoreboard_flair**: The item definition index used as the bot's scoreboard flair (optional, `0` clears it).

If `scoreboard_flair` is missing, invalid, or set to `0`, BotHider leaves the scoreboard flair empty.
Use [unicbm/cs2-econ-id-index](https://github.com/unicbm/cs2-econ-id-index) to look up valid scoreboard flair item definition IDs.

When a bot is spawned, BotHider will pick an identity from this list (preferring a name match if possible).  
To use the names from this file as the bot's **display name**, set `bh_namesource 1`.

## FAQ

**Q: I changed the `steamid` in an existing `bot_info.json` entry, but the bot still loads the old account. Why?**

A: The plugin selects an identity entry by matching the bot's name (from `botprofile.db`) against the JSON **keys**, not by the SteamID value. If no name match is found, a random entry is used. To force a specific bot to use a specific Steam profile:

1. Use a real `botprofile.db` bot name as the key in `bot_info.json`.
2. Set your custom `steamid` (32-bit account ID) and `crosshair_code` under that key.
3. Set `bh_namesource 1` so the display name also comes from this entry (ensuring a one-to-one name/SteamID link).
4. Spawn the bot with `bot_add <that name>`.

**Q: Can I give the same SteamID to multiple bots?**

A: No. The CS2 scoreboard distinguishes players by SteamID. If multiple bots share the same SteamID, some will not appear correctly. Each bot that needs a specific avatar must have its own distinct SteamID.

**Q: Can I change a bot's identity in game?**

A: Yes. Use `bh_setsid <slot> <SteamID64>` and `bh_setname <slot> <name>` to assign a new SteamID or name to a bot already in the game.
